# AngularFinalProject

This is my Year 2 - Semester 2 - Web Programming - Final Project 

This web app uses the API fixer.io to return conversion rates from the EURO currency to five other currencies. 

The app was limited by the restrictions imposed by the API. 

To convert FROM currencies other than EURO a subbscription must be paid for the API.

The web app allows you to enter an input amount, choose a currency you would like to convert from and choose a currency you would like to convert to, and displays the calculated result to the user.

These rate results can then be added to a NoSQL database (FireStore) and the project was hosted on Firebase.



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
